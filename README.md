# Make It Pop!

This library serves as a wrapper for GSAP and ScrollTrigger to make some of the most common setups faster and easier to execute.

## Installation

At some point this will be made into an NPM module. Currently development is still very active and it is too soon to publish.

If you would like to use in a project, fork this repo to freeze the state.

Then you can make any changes you desire, but still have the option to pull in future updates.

Copy the contents of the src directory into a project with gsap installed and import the helpers where required.

## Usage

The library can be broken into a few sections:

### Helpers

The `each` helper allows you to quickly search a page for instances of a section and then wraps functionality within a scoped forEach loop. This is very useful for creating multiple scroll trigger instances.

```
